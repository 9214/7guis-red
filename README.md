#### About

[7GUIs benchmark](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis) tasks implemented in [Red programming language](https://www.red-lang.org).

This repository serves a threefold purpose:
* Fresh take on all seven challenges, without peeking into existing solutions;
* Baseline for comparison of Red's approach to GUI programming with other mainstream toolkits;
* Evaluation of VID dialect and View engine, search for their potential improvements.

#### Setup

1. Download the latest release from the [official website](https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html).
1. Having toolchain binary and this repository in place, check out examples
	* from the interpreter (`do %<filename>` or `File > Run...` in Red console);
	* or via compilation for your platform of choice (see `red --help` for more info).
