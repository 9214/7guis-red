# About

https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis[7GUIs] benchmark tasks implemented in https://www.red-lang.org[Red] programming language.

This project serves a fourfold purpose:

. Fresh take on all the seven challenges, without peeking into existing solutions;
. Baseline for comparison of Red's approach to GUI programming with other mainstream toolkits;
. Evaluation of VID dialect and View engine, search for their potential improvements;
. Testbed for GUI backends supported by View.

Other known implementations:

* https://github.com/greggirwin/7guis/tree/master/Red[Gregg Irwin].

## Status

All the 7 challenges are completed and clock under 270 lines of code, barring script headers.

The project was tested on all supported View backends with Red https://github.com/red/red/commit/32f10e8a3cb058fd3274bc024f65a809124dd699[`32f10e8`]; the following issues were found:

# Setup

. Clone project's repository.
. Setup the Red toolchain by downloading automated build from the https://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html[official website].
. Having toolchain binary and this repository in place, check out the implemented tasks:
    * with `red <filename>` from system shell;
    * from the interpreter (`do %<filename>` or `File > Run...` in Red console);
    * or via compilation for your platform of choice (see `red --help` for details).

Alternatively, Red console and 7GUIs tasks can be built https://github.com/red/red#running-red-from-the-sources-for-contributors[from sources].
